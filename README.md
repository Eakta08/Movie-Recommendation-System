This is a project based on Content Based Recommendation System using Streamlit. It simplifies movie selection by recommending similar movies when a specific film is searched, providing a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience. It recommends a list of the top 10 movies that are similar to the one being searched for. Hope you enjoy it:)

**To run the below code you need to install streamlit :** pip install streamlit <br><br>
**Then run the below code in command prompt :** streamlit run app.py (make sure you have entered the current directory where app.py is present using 'cd' command)
